      <li>Enforcing selinux (except MI11T Pro)</li>
      <li>Play integrity will pass out of the box. If Play integrity fails, reboot once or run "su -c pif-updater" on terminal if you have root</li>
      <li>Only kernel with the same base as stock will boot.</li>
      <li>battery backup??? its oplus what do you expect?? same as hyperos most of the times...</li>
      <li>LET THE ROM SETTLE! this is oplus.. it takes abt 1-3 days</li>
      <li>DONT EVEN TRY TURNING ON DT2W/Raise2Wake from launcher settings (deepsleep dead/idle drain will get worse) use the one on System settings instead!</li>
      <li>Dont switch to NON KSU kernel cz it'll break stuff (transition script fixes needs ksu domain cz stock domain spits out unfixable denials)</li>
      <li>if 5g doesn't work even after flashing your latest regional fw, go to your latest regional miui then use 5g there.. then go back to oos & flash your latest regional fw.</li>
